This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the first landing page for which I made the design myself. It was quite an interesting experience, and I'm glad to share it with whoever will check it out on my portfolio. Thanks to this project, I got familiar with GSAP and its wonderful animations.
