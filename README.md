# Lumine - landing page

This is my first self-designed landing page. It was quite an interesting experience, and I'm glad to share it with whoever will check it out on my portfolio.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

Here's the link to my design on Figma: 

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SLQrXKEVI1pcjMqpWnHy5O/Lumine?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=llnGXX3NYPZ4luc9-1)

## Implementation details

- **Design** This project made me learn a lot about Figma, and creating basic web-designs in general.

- **Layout** As I get more and more familiar with all the intricasies of flexboxes, it makes controlling the layout all the easier.

- **Responsiveness** I was trying to replace fixed values with the relative-to-the-screen-size ones to enhance the responsiveness and overall look across different devices.

- **Framework** Yet again, React made the coding experience more concise, efficient, and straightforward for me.

- **Animations** To make the landing more dynamic, I learned the basics of GSAP and its ScrollTrigger plugin, which I later implemented in the page itself.

## Technologies used

- CreateReactApp
- HTML
- CSS (Sass)
- React.js

All in all, it was a really fun landing to design and implement!
